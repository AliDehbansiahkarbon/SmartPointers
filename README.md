# SmartPointers (Garbage collector simulator) for Delphi.
## This repo includes five different implementations of SmartPointers in Delphi to simulate a simple garbage collector.
In this way you will bind your objects to a reference counting supported object like an interface or a record and this object 
will automatically free the referenced object at the end of the scope.
You just create your object and don't worry about freeing anymore.


## There is a sample vcl app to demonstrate the usage.
